IDEA: Autonomous Distributed Trading System

Description: An automated trading system that uses machine learning to make trading decisions and executes trades in a distributed manner.

    Distributed Computing: Utilize multiple servers for data collection, decision-making, and trade execution.
    Networking: Implement TCP/IP communication for real-time market data feeds and order submission.
    Operating Systems: Manage concurrent tasks, such as data analysis, decision-making, and order processing.
    Databases: Store historical market data, trading logs, and model parameters.
    Machine Learning: Develop and train models to predict market trends and make trading decisions.
    Object-Oriented Design: Create classes for market data, trading strategies, order management, and machine learning models
